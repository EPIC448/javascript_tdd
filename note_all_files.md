/  arears of Challenges I picked up.

    All files are using TDD test files using jest

 //Testing our code using Jest.  
 To have test run automaticly after each save, you add:
  ./package.json
   inside 
    "scripts: "{
  "testwatch": "jest --watchAll"  

    }

    Then in terminal run command "npm run testwatch"

     When you run or save files. it works
